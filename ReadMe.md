<!-- This C++ project is designed to implement a game called PACMAN. PACMAN is character controlled game for user, by using the keyboard. The player guides PACMAN through a maze, while eating dots (called pac-dots) which adds to the score. When PACMAN eats enough pac-dots in a particular level, user is promoted to the next level. -->
<!-- A few enemies (called MONSTERS) roam the maze, trying to castch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches PACMAN game ends. -->
<!-- In order to play game for the first time you need to create a new account and then by logging in you can 
play the game with instructions provided about how to use the keyboard keys for playing -->
<!-- It supports multiple players. Players can create accounts, and play independently. The progress of every player is saved in a dat file in binary format, as implementing it via file handling. The player can continue playing from where he last played by just logging in, using his username and password. -->
<!-- PACMAN, the MONSTERS and the player are treated as objects each with characteristic features, working independently and also integrated as a whole, thus enforcing Object Oriented Programming. -->
<!-- The game uses graphics to make the game-play more attractive and user friendly. -->
