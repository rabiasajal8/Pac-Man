# Pac-Man
🎮Pac-Man Game👾🚀

So excited to share my second semester achievement. I created this game with my group member @zenabrizwan. 

🚀We together implemented object-oriented principles to design and code the classic Pac-Man game.

💡Transformed theoretical concepts into a fully functional and entertaining project.🚀
